        <h2 align="center">THE BOARD </h2>
        <p>
            The checkerboard has 64 alternating white and dark green squares. 
            The game is played on the dark green squares. 
            Each player (red and black) start with 12 regular pieces.

        <h2 align="center">MOVING PIECES </h2>
        <p>
            When it is your turn, click on a piece you want to move. 
            The selected piece and the possible movements you can make with it will be highlighted. 
            Click on a highlighted cell to complete your move. 
            You can also select a different piece to complete your move with.

        <h2 align="center">THE REGULAR PIECES</h2>
        <p>
            A regular piece can only move "forward" (towards the other side of the board than where you started). 
            It can move or jump (double jumping isn't allowed in our version) in any of the two "forward" diagonal directions as long as the piece stays on the board. 
            Note: there can be times when a piece has no possible moves.
        </p>

        <h2 align="center"> JUMPING </h2>
        <p>
            Once you jump over a piece, it is removed from the board and placed in jail.

        <h2 align="center"> KINGS </h2>
        <p>
            Once you reach the other end of the board with a piece, it turns into a king. 
            The king has more possible movements. 
            A king can move or jump in any of the four diagonal directions as long as the piece stays on the board.

        <h2 align="center"> HOW TO WIN </h2>
        <p>
            You win by capturing all of the other player's pieces, or by putting the other player into a position where they cannot make any moves. 
            A player can also win if the other player forfeits the game (either during the middle of the game, or when they run out of moves).
